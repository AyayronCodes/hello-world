I like tacos, sushi and fruit smoothies. Oh, did I tell you that I like burgers and sandwiches too? Can't leave out pizza and calzones as well. By the way, on sunny days like today, you have to get yourself a nice, icy frapuccino. It's definitely a major crime not to treat yourself with frap. I don't know if I spelled it correctly though. Another difficult word to spell is saurkraut. Hope I spelled this one correctly. Oh, you probably know that saurkraut goes extremely well with a reuben sandwich, right? On fine days like this, you just have to ... Oh my god, I almost forget about baked ziti! Back when I lived in NJ, I devoured some of the best Italian food I've ever had. Used to get buffalo chicken slices all the time. Baked ziti was my fav but it was kinda pricey. Understandable though, that baked ziti could definitely fill up two to three hungry teenagers, but I had no friends to share it with :(
